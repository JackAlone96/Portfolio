Hi, I am Giovanni Giacalone, a 28 years old Game Programmer from Italy currently looking for my first challenge!

I am a curious, hard working and self motivated person, always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities.
After a parenthesis in the psychology field I decided to pursue my lifetime passion, videogames, with a clear object in mind: take part in the development
of great videogames that give back a good feeling to players.<br>
Thanks to my previous experiences and academic background I developed optimal organizational, relational and comunicational skills that allow me to work really well in a team setting and to efficiently adapt to new situations.

I consider myself a problem solver and codewise I code with flexibility and cleanliness in mind, always on the lookout for potential room for improvement and bugs.<br>
Contrary to the expectations I take bugs as a challenge, an opportunity to improve my knowledge and to make things better!

In my free time I like to play videogames (of course) and my favorite genres are JRPG (Final Fantasy and Persona series), soulsborne and metroidvania.<br>
Another passion of mine is to read about space and to keep myself updated about new discoveries and (hopefully soon) about new space explorations.

If you want to know more feel free to explore the rest of my website and to get in touch with me by phone, message or email!<br>
